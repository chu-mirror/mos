# MOS - My OS

I decide to write a operating system to learn something...

It's still at beginning, and I'm not sure how to complete it for now,
just list a TODO list here to remind myself.

## TODO

1. driver of UART, print something(maybe _Hello world!_).
	- print "Hel" successfully

2. log system, record(wait for file system) or print debug information.
